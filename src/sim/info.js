// Skill-gated information: what the player can PERCEIVE is a progression
// reward. Two tiers: `senseReq` (exact hp/power) and `aiSenseReq` (always >=
// senseReq — you learn to read a fight before you learn to read a mind),
// which reveals the enemy's live AI state. Pure read helpers; the renderer
// consumes these, the sim never depends on them.
//
// What the two thresholds are compared AGAINST depends on the enemy kind's
// `confidenceGated` flag (see content.js's doc comment on enemyKinds):
// - Regular guard kinds (confidenceGated: true): against `player.intel[kind]`
//   — a per-kind counter built from real encounters with THAT kind, win or
//   loss (reduce.js's hitEnemy/ENEMY_STRIKE). "The enemies got smart" becomes
//   "you got a read on them," and the read is earned per-kind, not granted by
//   a global stat.
// - The Warden (no flag): against the flat `player.skills.perception.lvl`,
//   same mechanism the trilogy has always used. A deliberate exception, not
//   a leftover — it's fought exactly once, so there's nothing to accumulate
//   across encounters; forcing the confidence framing onto a one-shot fight
//   would just rename the existing boss-taunt event, not read anything the
//   player actually did differently.
